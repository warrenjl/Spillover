# Spillover: Spatial Change Point Estimation Due to Spillover from a Point Source

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression analysis to estimate a spatial change point corresponding to spillover from a point source while simultaneously accounting for small scale spatial variability via spatially correlated random effects (spherical covariance function). A similar method was used to estimated spillover of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from a prison in Lima Peru (Warren et al. 2018). Please see the "Spillover_Model_Details" and "Spillover_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
